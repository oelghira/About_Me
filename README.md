## Hi, I'm Omar El-Ghirani 
Let me introduce myself! I am a statistician, data analyst & enthusiast, an up n coming data scientist, team and goal oriented, determined student of life! :sunglasses:

### Career to date
I’ve spent my career diving into numbers in multitude of fields to drive the organization towards its goals. I’ve been in the fields of retail, retail banking, marketing, manufacturing, aerospace, and currently in guiding the operations of heath care technology management! In all of my roles, I believe I have made an impact and left my team in a better position than when I began. 

### Career path I'm on...
Through out my time as a professional in analytics, I’ve been focused on what took place in the past or current operations. I would like to see my career move past the present day towards predictive analytics and data science. I am confident I have all the necessary tools and the curiosity to continue to learn and grow in this field to make a real impact! I am confident because I believe I have the ability and natural curiosity to learn about solutions to new problems in data science as well as the knowledge that an impact can't be made without understanding the business and downstream effects of any potential solution. 

When considering a new position I look for 3 things:  
1)	A challenging opportunity to keep exploring and learning new things   
2)	A collaborative team with diversity of thought and background  
3)	The ability for my work to make real positive impact for the business and its customers
